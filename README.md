Artificial intelligence or machine-learning-based forecasting of reservoir water availability based on historical water availability, hydro-meteorological data, and water demand. Creation of visualizations and dissemination of forecasted water availability and other important hydro-meteorological datasets to help inform decision-making and shifting towards water-sensitive practices.

Performance metrics for Modelling and Prediction  for the below Datasets considered are 



**Daily reservoir water data for the 4  reservoirs Kabini,Harangi,Hemavathi,KSR

**Key contextual shapefiles

**A link to Aqueduct water risk indicators



Groundwater Research paper:
Groundwater Level Dynamics in Bengaluru City, India
Groundwater- important source of drinking water
meets nearly 85% of rural domestic water needs and 50% of urban water needs [
Factors affecting increase groundwater system dependence:
no accelerated growth
increasing per capita water use
poor reliability of imported surface water from distant sources
Urbanization is affecting ground water availability
in many dense cities in arid areas, water supply imports are greater than annual rainfall
In this paper, we focus on understanding the groundwater patterns and dynamics in Bengaluru
 The area of city limits, has also grown substantiallyâ€”ten times from a mere 75 km2 in 1901
In Bangalore-groundwater is heavily used
CGWB has estimated that groundwater is more than 100% developed in Bengaluru, which means that abstraction (pumping) is more than recharge to the aquifer
Objectives of this paper:
 collecting a time series of groundwater table depths and using the data to study the spatial patterns in groundwater levels;
 estimating net groundwater storage changes Sustainability 2018, 10, 26 3 of 22 during drought year 2016 and during extreme rainfall periods
estimating the rainfall recharge factor net groundwater flux. 
Water needs of the city is majorly from----- Cauvery waters and groundwater.
Surface water imported from the Cauvery River, currently at close to 1400 million liters per day is approximately 75% of the average rainfall over the city,
although surface water supply has increased over time, it has been unable to catch up with the rapid growth and expansion of the city
So result---groundwater gives the largest proportion
Groundwater levels (GWL) were measured using a monitoring network of 158 wells in an area of 700 km
