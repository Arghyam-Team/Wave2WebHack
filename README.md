Artificial intelligence or machine-learning-based forecasting of reservoir water availability based on historical water availability, hydro-meteorological data, and water demand. Creation of visualizations and dissemination of forecasted water availability and other important hydro-meteorological datasets to help inform decision-making and shifting towards water-sensitive practices.

Key Performance metrics considered are 

**Daily reservoir water data for the 4 select reservoirs

**Key contextual shapefiles

**A link to Aqueduct water risk indicators
